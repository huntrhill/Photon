# Photon Laser Tag System

Main software for running Photon laser tag matches.  
Written in **Python 3** with **PyQt5**, it connects to the provided **PostgreSQL** database, handles **UDP traffic** for scoring and events, plays synchronized **MP3 music**, and manages the operator UI for two teams: **Red** and **Green**.

## Features

- **Splash screen** (3s) with provided logo

## System Requirements

- **Debian 12+ VM** (provided by instructor)
- **PostgreSQL** with database `photon` and table `players` already installed
- Internet access for package installs

---

## Installation

Clone the repo into your Debian VM:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huntrhill/Photon.git
cd Photon
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:

- Create a Python virtual environment (.venv)

- Install dependencies from requirements.txt

- If PyQt5 fails (common on Debian VMs), it will automatically install Debianâ€™s system python3-pyqt5 and rebuild the venv with --system-site-packages

- Validate that all modules import correctly (PyQt5, pygame, psycopg2, etc.)

---

## Running
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```
